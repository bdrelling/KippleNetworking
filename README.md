A Swift library that offers cross-platform (Apple and Linux) networking support, intended for the creation of cross-platform SDKs to be used in projects spanning across iOS/macOS/tvOS/watchOS and Server-side Swift.

> :warning: The code in this library has been made public as-is for the purposes of education, discovery, and personal use. It is **NOT** production-ready; however, if you're interested in leveraging this library as a dependency for your own projects, feel free to do so (at your own risk) and open GitHub issues for any problems you encounter and I will do my best to provide support.
